## Response:

Excellent list 👌  
Let’s go through these concepts one by one clearly and simply—like in a structured math glossary.  
I’ll divide them into **Number Types**, **Basic Operations**, **Number Forms**, and **Exponents & Radicals** so it’s easier to follow.

---

## 🧮 **1\. Number Types**

### **Natural Numbers (ℕ)**

- **Definition:** These are the numbers we use for _counting_.
- **Examples:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …
- **Note:** Some textbooks include **0** in natural numbers; others start at 1.
- **On a number line:** They start at 1 (or 0) and move to the right indefinitely.

---

### **Whole Numbers**

- **Definition:** All natural numbers **plus 0**.
- **Examples:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …
- **Key Difference:** Whole numbers = Natural numbers ∪ {0}.

---

### **Real Numbers (ℝ)**

- **Definition:** All numbers that can be represented on the number line.
- This includes:
  - **Rational numbers** → numbers that can be written as a fraction (e.g., ½, -3, 0.75).
  - **Irrational numbers** → numbers that **cannot** be written as a simple fraction, like √2, π, or e.
- **Examples:** -5, 0, 3.7, √2, π
- **Visualization:** The real number line includes **every point**, not just whole steps.

---

## ➕ **2\. Basic Operations**

### **Addition (+)**

- **Definition:** Combining two or more numbers to get a _total_ or _sum_.
- **Example:** 4 + 3 = 7
- **Tip:** Think of moving **to the right** on the number line.

---

### **Difference (−)**

- **Definition:** Finding how much one number differs from another → also known as **subtraction**.
- **Example:** 9 − 5 = 4
- **Tip:** Think of moving **to the left** on the number line.

---

### **Product (×)**

- **Definition:** The result of multiplying numbers together.
- **Example:** 6 × 4 = 24
- **Tip:** Multiplication is repeated addition (e.g., 6 × 4 = 6+6+6+6).

---

## ✍️ **3\. Number Forms**

### **Fraction**

- **Definition:** A way to represent a part of a whole, written as **a/b** where _a_ is the numerator and _b_ is the denominator.
- **Example:** ¾ means 3 parts out of 4.
- **Tip:** You can convert fractions ↔ decimals ↔ percentages.

---

### **Numerical Expression**

- **Definition:** A combination of numbers and operations, **without** an equal sign.
- **Example:** 4 × (3 + 7) ÷ 2
- **Tip:** To evaluate, follow **order of operations** (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).

---

### **Decimal Number**

- **Definition:** A number that uses a **decimal point** to show parts of a whole.
- **Examples:** 2.5, 0.75, 13.042
- **Tip:** Every decimal can be written as a fraction (e.g., 0.75 = ¾).

---

### **Percentage (%)**

- **Definition:** A way to express a number **as a fraction of 100**.
- **Examples:** 25% = 25/100 = 0.25
- **Tip:** The word “percent” literally means “per hundred”.

---

## ✨ **4\. Exponents & Radicals**

### **Exponent**

- **Definition:** The **small number** written above and to the right of a base, showing how many times to multiply the base by itself.
- **Example:** In $3^4$ , **4** is the exponent, meaning 3 × 3 × 3 × 3.

---

### **Power**

- **Definition:** The **entire expression** involving a base and an exponent.
- **Example:** $3^4$ is read as “3 to the power of 4”.
- **Result:** $3^4 = 81$ .

---

### **Base**

- **Definition:** The **number being multiplied** by itself.
- **Example:** In $5^3$ , the base is 5.

---

### **Radical (√)**

- **Definition:** The **opposite of exponentiation**; it finds a number which, when multiplied by itself a certain number of times, gives the original number.
- **Example:** √9 = 3 because 3² = 9.
- **Tip:** The √ symbol is for the **square root**, but you can also have cube roots (³√), fourth roots, etc.

Would you like me to generate a **printable PDF flashcard sheet** with these glossary definitions and examples? It’s great for quick revision.
