In number theory, we often study different **families of numbers**—sets with shared properties—that form the foundation of the subject. Here are the main ones, from broad to more specialized:

---

### 1. **Natural Numbers**

* **Notation:** $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ (sometimes includes $0$, depending on convention).
* **Role in number theory:** Building blocks of arithmetic; everything starts here.
* **Key feature:** They’re used for counting and ordering.

---

### 2. **Integers**

* **Notation:** $\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$.
* **Role:** Expands the naturals by including negatives.
* **Key feature:** Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

---

### 3. **Rational Numbers**

* **Notation:** $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \tfrac{a}{b} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0 \right\}$.
* **Role:** Ratios of integers.
* **Key feature:** Dense in the number line; includes fractions and terminating/repeating decimals.

---

### 4. **Real Numbers**

* **Notation:** $\mathbb{R}$.
* **Role:** Completes the number line. Includes rationals **and** irrationals (like $\sqrt{2}, \pi$).
* **Key feature:** Continuous — no "gaps."

---

### 5. **Complex Numbers**

* **Notation:** $\mathbb{C} = \{ a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{R}, i^2 = -1 \}$.
* **Role:** Extends real numbers to solve equations like $x^2 + 1 = 0$.
* **Key feature:** Every polynomial equation has solutions in $\mathbb{C}$ (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra).

---

Now, within **number theory** specifically, some **special subfamilies** of integers are especially important:

---

### 6. **Prime Numbers**

* **Definition:** Natural numbers $p > 1$ whose only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$.
* **Role:** "Atoms" of the integers (unique factorization).

---

### 7. **Composite Numbers**

* **Definition:** Integers $> 1$ that are not prime.
* **Example:** $4, 6, 9, 12$.

---

### 8. **Perfect Numbers**

* **Definition:** Equal to the sum of their proper divisors.
* **Example:** $6 = 1 + 2 + 3$.

---

### 9. **Square Numbers (Quadratic Family)**

* **Definition:** Integers of the form $n^2$.
* **Role:** Fundamental in Diophantine equations and modular arithmetic.

---

### 10. **Other Special Families**

* **Even & Odd Numbers**: Based on divisibility by 2.
* **Fibonacci Numbers**: Recursive sequence, deep ties to algebra and modular arithmetic.
* **Polygonal Numbers**: Numbers that form geometric shapes (triangular, pentagonal, etc.).

---

✅ So, in short:

* **General families:** Naturals, Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex.
* **Number theory focus:** Subsets of the integers—especially **primes** and their relatives.

Would you like me to make you a **diagram/tree** that shows how all these families relate (like a hierarchy from broad to specific)?
